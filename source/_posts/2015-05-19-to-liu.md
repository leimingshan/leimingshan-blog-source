Liu Xi:
You will never know how many time I met with you in my dream, even like last night.
I really want to be together with you, just like back in my childhood. You can't imagine,
when I was really bold enough to say your name in front of the class and our teacher. I
know what your really name is, of course I know. I can't just mention your really name any
more. I'm so sorry. Even in my dream, that's just one day.I ran after you, I know your face,
it's still like 20 years ago. I really wish you could stay with me for a little longer. But
I can't find you in the end and I was back at my college.

Still like the past, if I could choose again, I would choose to stay with you all. It's not
my choise, and I could not blame my father. And now, I know you are married, you have a happy
life. And I know it's better that way than with me.

I wish I could meet you again in my dream.

Best Wishes
Farewell

Yours,
Lei

After so long time, I'm back here. And I know, deeply in my heart, it's you. It's pure emotion about you.
